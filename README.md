# Hook Form

Create a form like the following wireframe with a React Component and hooks. Then, show in real time, the data that is being inputted into the form below.

Add error messages:

1. If the First Name or Last Name is less than 2 characters, output an error message saying that field must be at least 2 characters.
2. The e-mail is less than 5 characters, say the field must be at lease 5 characters.
3. The passwords must match and be at least 8 characters.
4. These messages can appear right when you render the page, and will disappear in real time.
